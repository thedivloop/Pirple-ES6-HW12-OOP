# Homework Assignment #12: Object Oriented Programming
# Overview
In object oriented programming (OOP) one use an object template (sometimes in the form of a class) or prototype that serves as model. That model is then instanciated as many times as required to create different "beings" which are also objects.
An object prototype can have properties and methods. Let's imagine that we create a model object named car. A car has properties including color, length, width, height, brand, model, year, etc. That car object can do things, move, accelerate, brake, honk, etc. Everytime the model is instanciated we give it a name and set some or all of its properties. We can set properties when we first intanciate it or later on.

# In which cases would an OOP pattern be a better choice?
Object-oriented design patterns typically show relationships and interactions between classes or objects, without specifying the final application classes or objects that are involved. Patterns that imply mutable state may be unsuited for functional programming languages, some patterns can be rendered unnecessary in languages that have built-in support for solving the problem they are trying to solve, and object-oriented patterns are not necessarily suitable for non-object-oriented languages.
In short whenever a model is used to specify objects having similar properties and behavior then objects oriented programming is a good approach.
